	Uses a kmeans model and a network model to find similarities.
	Uses tableau to display these similarities and descriptions of each county provided.

Execution:
	The top five filters allow the user to specify what information for the base county they might desire. If looking for a specific county submit for state and county. Ex. Georgia as State and Fulton as County.
	Within "Base Map" click on associated county to select it.
	Details to the right of the map will then populate for that county and the year selected for it.
	The "Analysis Map" will then populate depending on the view. For the Network model select Network to get the similarity for each county available in the United States.
	Changing view to "Kmeans" will optionally populate the analysis map with clusters for the counties.
	From here select the county from the analysis map to properly populate the detail level to the right of the map.
